# Welcome to Mobile Robots!

Hello students and visitors! This is the official webpage for
**16-761: Mobile Robots**.

- **Instructor**: Wennie Tabib
- **Office**: LL 05, Building Collaborative Innovation Commons
- **Contact**: wtabib (at) cmu.edu

This lecture-based course comprises four modules that present both
theory and practice of mobile robot algorithms. These modules will be
associated with four assignments through which students will build a
autonomy software package. In the first lab, we will add vehicle
dynamics simulation and linear control capabilities.  The second
assignment aims at adding mapping and state estimation capability. The
third assignment will enable students to add motion planners. Finally,
the fourth assignment combines the capabilities from the previous
modules into an exploration system.


# Learning Objectives
When you complete this course, you will be able to:
* Aerial Robot Autonomy: Implement a framework for autonomous quadrotor navigation and exploration.
* Development Skills: Plan software development efforts that address robotics applications.
* Software Artifacts: Develop a nontrivial mobile robot application.
* Algorithmic Familiarity: Implement key probabilisitc algorithms in mobile robotics.

# Pre-requisites
Undergraduate-level understanding of probability, statistics, and
algorithms is assumed. Experience with Python and basic familiarity
with linear algebra, probability theory, and ordinary differential
equations will benefit the student throughout the semester.

# Learning Resources
There is no textbook required for this course. Slides and additional
references for further reading will be provided with each lecture on
the course website.

# Assessments
This course implements software for mobile robots. Consequently, the
assessments depend heavily on programming. We will be using the Python
programming languages throughout the course. Your final grade in this
course will be assessed according to:

* 90% Homework
* 10% Project

# Homework
Four mandatory assignments will be provided during the semester. All
homework will be distributed using GitHub and collected using
AutoLab. AutoLab will enable auto-grading and feedback for students to
help them finalize submissions. Grades will be returned within one
week of homework due dates.
