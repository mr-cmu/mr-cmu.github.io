# Welcome to Mobile Robots!

Hello students and visitors! This is the official webpage for
**16-761: Mobile Robots**.

- **Class Dates and Times**: Tuesdays and Thursdays 1100-1220 in NSH 1305
- **Instructor**: Wennie Tabib
- **Office**: LL 05, Building Collaborative Innovation Commons
- **Contact**: wtabib (at) cmu.edu

This lecture-based course comprises four modules that present both
theory and practice of mobile robot algorithms. These modules will be
associated with five assignments through which students will build a
autonomy software package. A short introductory assignment (assignment
0) will serve as an introduction to manipulating rotations and
transforms. In assignment 1, we will add vehicle dynamics simulation
and linear control capabilities.  Assignment 2 aims at adding
mapping and state estimation capability. Assignment 3 will
enable students to add motion planners. Finally, in the assignment 4
we will combine the capabilities from the previous modules into an
exploration system.

# Learning Objectives
When you complete this course, you will be able to:
* Aerial Robot Autonomy: Implement a framework for autonomous quadrotor navigation and exploration.
* Development Skills: Plan software development efforts that address robotics applications.
* Software Artifacts: Develop a nontrivial mobile robot application.
* Algorithmic Familiarity: Implement key probabilisitc algorithms in mobile robotics.

# Pre-requisites
Undergraduate-level understanding of probability, statistics, and
algorithms is assumed. Experience with Python and basic familiarity
with linear algebra, probability theory, and ordinary differential
equations will benefit the student throughout the semester.

# Learning Resources
There is no textbook required for this course. Slides and additional
references for further reading will be provided with each lecture on
the course website.

# Assessments
This course implements software for mobile robots. Consequently, the
assessments depend heavily on programming. We will be using the Python
programming languages throughout the course. Your final grade in this
course will be assessed according to:

* 90% Homework
  * assignment0: 10% (Rotations & Transforms)
  * assignment1: 20% (Quadrotor Dynamics & Control)
  * assignment2: 20% (Mapping & State Estimation)
  * assignment3: 20% (Quadrotor Planning)
  * assignment4: 20% (Exploration)
* 10% Project
  * 2%: form groups and upload project proposal by Feb. 20
    * Upload a document containing bullet points of the following information for your project:
	  * Motivation
	  * Related work
	  * Approach you will implement
	  * Evaluation
	  * Anticipated results
  * 2%: upload checkpoint document by March 18
    * 1-2 paragraphs on what was completed and what needs to be finished
  * 6%: final project presentation (Apr. 17, Apr. 22, Apr. 24)

# Homework
Five mandatory assignments will be provided during the semester. All
homework will be distributed using GitHub and collected using
AutoLab. AutoLab will enable auto-grading and feedback for students to
help them finalize submissions. Grades will be returned within one
week of homework due dates.

# Project
Students will be required to work together in teams of 2-4 to complete
a group project. The project will be worth 10% of the final grade.  2%
of that grade will come from group formation and uploading a project
proposal by Feb. 20 containing bullet points of the motivation,
related work, approach, evaluation, and anticipated results. 2% of the
grade will come from uploading a checkpoint document by March 18. The
remaining 6% will come from the final project presentation, which is
scheduled on the last 3 days of class.
