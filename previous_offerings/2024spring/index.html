      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <p>
        This lecture-based course comprises four modules that present both
        theory and practice of mobile robot algorithms. These modules will be
        associated with four assignments through which students will
        build a autonomy software package. In the first lab, we will
        add vehicle dynamics simulation and linear control capabilities.
        The second assignment aims at adding mapping and state
        estimation capability. The third assignment will enable students to
        add motion planners. Finally, the fourth assignment combines the
        capabilities from the previous modules into an exploration system.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        When you complete this course, you will be able to:
        <ul>
            <li>Aerial Robot Autonomy: Implement a framework for autonomous quadrotor navigation and exploration.</li>
            <li>Development Skills: Plan software development efforts that address robotics applications.</li>
            <li>Software Artifacts: Develop a nontrivial mobile robot application.</li>
            <li>Algorithmic Familiarity: Implement key probabilisitc algorithms in mobile robotics.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        Undergraduate-level understanding of probability, statistics, and
        algorithms is assumed. Experience with Python and basic
        familiarity with linear algebra, probability theory, and ordinary differential equations will benefit the
        student throughout the semester.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
      <p>
    There is no textbook required for this course. Slides and additional references
    for further reading will be provided with each lecture on the course website.
      </p>

    <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <p>
    This course implements software for mobile
    robots. Consequently, the assessments depend heavily on
    programming. We will be using the Python programming
    languages throughout the course. Your final grade in this
    course will be assessed according to:
      </p>
    <ul>
        <li>90% Homework</li>
        <li>10% Participation</li>
    </ul>

    The participation grade will be calculated based on the in-class Piazza polls responses.

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p>
    Four mandatory assignments will be provided during the
    semester. All homework will be distributed using GitHub and
    collected using AutoLab. AutoLab will enable auto-grading and
    feedback for students to help them finalize submissions. Grades
    will be returned within one week of homework due dates.
    </p>

    <h2>Office Hours</h2>
    <p>
    TA office hours will be held at the following times:
    <ul>
      <li>Mondays at 1700-1800ET, NSH 3305 </li>
      <li>Thursdays at 1700-1800ET, NSH 3305 </li>
    </ul>

    Instructor office hour:
    <ul>
      <li> Tuesdays at 1000-1100ET, NSH 1103 or by appointment</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of office hours, Piazza will be used for all communication.
      Use public posts to ask questions that you would like answered by the course staff or your classmates.
      Use public posts to share any course related content with course staff and your classmates.
      Post privately to the teaching assistant(s) if you have specific questions regarding your
      performance on homeworks and the course. Post privately to the instructors for anything else.
      If these private posts are not answered within 24 hours, please email with the subject line starting
      with [16-761 Student].
